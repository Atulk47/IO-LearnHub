# Assignment 3


You guys are supposed to create a react(vite) project there you are supposed to create a component(it can be more than that as well depending on your requirement). So that component is up to you. Make sure that you use that particular component in your final project.

You are free to choose your component however there are some restrictions.
- It should use React.
- The styling should use only tailwind
- The component should be complete in itself. For eg. a search bar that can filter cards, a functional sidebar, etc.

- Reusable - The component can be used on multiple websites without much change.
- Using GSAP is not a compulsion.
- Make sure that the component is responsive and the UI is well; fonts, color, and all are complimentary.
- Being creative will fetch more marks.
- Deploy on any provider - Vercel, Netlify, etc.
