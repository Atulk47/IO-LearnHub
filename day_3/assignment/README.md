# How to deploy

## Step 1:
- Create a new repository on [github](https://github.com/)
- Keep all the options default i.e. 
    - Its your wish to give the description to the repo.
    - Keep the repo **public**.
    - Don't add a `README.md`.
    - Don't add `.gitignore`.
    - Don't add license.
- Click `Create repository`


## Create files and folder
- Create required html and css files.
- Make sure that the main `index.html` should be at the root level.

> [!IMPORTANT]\
> If you have done any changes in the github repo that is deployed then you don't need to deploy it again, it will automatically be reflected in the same.


## Upload the files and folder to github
- After the github repo is created you will see a blue box in that particular repo with the title `Quick setup - if you've done this kind of thing before`
- There click on `upload an existing file`
- After that drag and drop the files and folder to the desired place.
- Give a suitable name to you commit.
- Click `Commit changes`

> 😀😀 Congratulations you have successfully upload all your code to github.

## Hosting
- Go to the same repo, it's url should be something like `www.github.com/[username]/[reponame]`
- Go to `settings`
- Go to `Pages` which is under `Code and automation`
- Select `Deploy from a branch` in the Source section
- Select `main > /(root)` under the branch section. Hit `save` 
- Give a `custom domain` to it, like `io-assignment-1` and hit `Save`
- Wait for 4-5 minutes, then refresh. You will get the deployed link.
