## [Introduction to JavaScript](/day_4/lessons/JS/)

JavaScript is a high-level, versatile, and widely-used programming language primarily employed for web development. It's essential for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites. JavaScript can run directly in web browsers, making it an integral part of front-end development. Additionally, it can be used on the server side through technologies like Node.js, enabling full-stack development.

## Importance of JS in web dev

1. Interactivity: JS allows you to create interactive and dynamic web applications, enhancing user engagement and providing a better user experience.

1. Form Validation: You can use JS to validate user input in forms, ensuring data accuracy and security.

1. DOM Manipulation: JS can manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), enabling real-time updates to web content without requiring full page reloads.

1. Frameworks and Libraries: JS has a rich ecosystem of frameworks and libraries (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js) that simplify web development and speed up project development.
