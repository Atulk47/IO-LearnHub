# Data Types

JavaScript has several primitive data types:

- **String**: Represents text and is enclosed in single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes.

  ```javascript
  let greeting = "Hello, World!";
  ```

- **Number**: Represents both integers and floating-point numbers.

  ```javascript
  let age = 25;
  let price = 19.99;
  ```

- **Boolean**: Represents true or false values.

  ```javascript
  let isUserLoggedIn = true;
  ```

- **Undefined**: Variables that have been declared but haven't been assigned a value are `undefined`.

  ```javascript
  let undefinedVariable;
  ```

- **Null**: Represents the absence of any object value.

  ```javascript
  let emptyValue = null;
  ```

- **Symbol** (ES6): Used for creating unique identifiers.

  ```javascript
  const uniqueID = Symbol("description");
  ```
