# Day 1 Challenges 

## Challenge 1

- Make a documentation page using HTML and basics of CSS.
- You may replicate the [screenshot](/day_2/challenge/challenge_readme.png) given below or make your own.
- It will be appreciated if you try to replicate any actual npm package documentation page or atleast a part of it, for example [chalk](/https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk). It may not look exactly the same but you will learn a lot of things while trying to do so.

## Things to keep in mind
- Make sure you use symantic tags
- Use (external) CSS to style your page.
- Make sure you include you*

## Tips
- The `padding` used here is `10px`
- Font color is `#FFF` and background color is `#000`, font-family is `sans-serif`
- I have used `blockquote` tag to write the html code. If you want to use `<body>` or any other tag in html as a plain text then you have to use [escape character](https://www.educative.io/answers/how-to-escape-unescape-html-characters-in-string-in-javascript) `&lt;` for `<` and `&gt;` for `>`.
- The `font-size` is `12px`, `color` is `#f3f3f3` and `padding` is `10px`
- You may modify this according to you.

It is advised to attempt this challenge on your own before having a look at the [solution](/day_2/solution/index.html).
